__Project Summary__
This repo contains an integrated front-end for the RESTful API created in earlier and linked below. It is a social news aggregator forum, which presents articles on the front-page that you can visit to see comments, vote positively or negatively on an article and post a comment yourself. Navigate to the topics page to filter articles based on topic, see the dropdown menus above any list of articles to sort by various properties and order them.
